# Heat-Check
This is my project on a case study of streaky shooting comparing J.R. Smith and Nick Young.

NOTE: I've been unable to upload the full dataset for this project and it may compromise its functionality. I used play-by-play data from 2012-14 and it exceeded the 25 MB maximum size that GitHub accepts. My report gives a comprehensive review of my work. Review of my code would also prove the thorough detail of my program. My apologies.
